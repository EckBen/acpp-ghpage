      <p>Most products require the selection of a specific location. Data from hourly precipitation stations are
         preferred for extreme rainfall analyses. Red dots on the map, show the location of the hourly precipitation
         stations used in this and the EC IDF analysis.</p>
      <h3>Specific Station Selection Interface</h3>
      <img src="help/img/Station_select.png" style="width:200px;" />

      <p> To select a specific station, click on one of the red station dots. The name of the selected station will
         appear
         in the Selected Station box on the interface. Once a station has been selected in this fashion, clicking the
         submit button will generate the desired extreme rainfall product using that station's data.
         Using the Zoom to Province/County menu will zoom the map to the selected area to assist in station selection.
      </p>

      <h3>Selection of Interpolated Grid Data</h3>

      <p> Extreme rainfall analyses can also be obtained based on station values that have been interopolated to a grid.
         To use this feature, check the Select Interpolated Grid box. Several options are available to select a grid
         point location – the easiest of which is to utilize the built-in Google Maps interface. To select a point,
         simply double-click – a red marker will appear and the web site will register the location. Panning and zooming
         can be done with the mouse or the controls at the left-side of the map.</p>

      <h3>Google Map Type Control</h3>

      <p>To clear the point that has been selected, simply double click a different location or use the address,
         lat/lon, or Province/Unit Selection boxes on the left side of the map. To reset the map view to the default
         zoom use the plus/minus icons on the bottom left.</p>
