<p>Most products require the selection of a specific location. Data from hourly precipitation stations are preferred for extreme rainfall analyses. However, extreme rainfall analyses can also be based on data that have been interpolated to a grid from the station locations.</p>

<h3>Selection of Interpolated Grid Data</h3>

<p> To access extreme rainfall analyses based on this interopolated to a grid, check the Select Interpolated Grid box.  Several options are available to select a grid point location – the easiest of which is to utilize the built-in Google Maps interface.  To select a point, simply double-click – a red marker will appear and the web site will register the location.  Panning and zooming can be done with the mouse or the controls at the left-side of the map.</p>

<h3>Google Map Type Control</h3>

<p>By Default the map appears in Hybrid view, additional views, including Satellite and Terrain, are available through the dropdown box in the top-left corner of the map interface.</p>

<h3>Hybrid map view (default)</h3>

<h3>Terrain map view</h3>

<h3>Satellite map view</h3>

<p>To clear the point that has been selected, simply double click a different location or use the address, lat/lon, or Province/Unit Selection boxes on the left side of the map.  To reset the map view to the default zoom use the plus/minus icons on the bottom left.</p>

<p>For details on selecting a location by a street address, latitude/longitude coordinates, or the center of a specific state or county, please reference the relevant help file.</p>

<h3>Specific Station Selection Interface</h3>
<img src="help/img/Station_select.png" style="width:200px;"/>

<p> To return to the default station selection interface, uncheck the Select Interpolated Grid box.  Red dots indicating station locations will appear. Click on one of the red station dots to select the desired station.  The name of the selected station will appear
in the Selected Station box on the interface.  Once a station has been selected in this fashion, clicking the submit button will generate the desired extreme rainfall product using that station's data.
 Using the Zoom to Province/County menu will zoom the map to the selected area to assist in station selection.</p>
