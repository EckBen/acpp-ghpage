      <p>Intensity Frequency Duration (also known as Intensity Duration Frequency or IDF) curves estimate peak rainfall
         intensity over a range of durations (subhourly, hourly, or daily) for a constant recurrence interval.</p>

      <p>This product specifically derives intensity (not return period amount) by dividing the return period amount
         estimate by the number of hours. The output display will show a graph generally with decreasing intensity as
         duration increases, since the highest intensity extreme precipitation events are usually observed with shorter
         durations. Given the range of intensities and durations depicted on by each curve, the graphs use logarithmic
         axes that produce straight-lined IDF curves.</p>

      <p>This product also provides a logarithmic interpolation of intensity for intermediate durations that are not
         specifically calculated. The non-interpolated values for base durations are shown by symbols on the graph. A
         table under the graph shows the calculated and estimated values for each duration.</p>
