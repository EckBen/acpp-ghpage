<h1>Search by Station ID</h1>

<p>This box allows users to search for a station's partial duration series by use of the 6-digit Cooperative (COOP) Station ID number (i.e. 304174).</p>

<p><i>From the <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/stationlocator.html">National Climatic Data Center</a>:</i> These stations are identified by a 6-digit number and are part of the National Weather Service's Cooperative Station Network. The first two digits designate a USA state or territory code. The last four digits are assigned to stations within a state in general accordance with the alphabetic order of the station name.</p>
