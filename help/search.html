<h1>Select Search Parameter(s)</h1>

<p>Used only in the Partial Duration Series (by Station) product, this tool allows users to search for a specific station.  The search parameters available are full or partial station ID number (6-digit COOP), station name (case insensitive), and state.</p>

<p>The search parameters use an 'AND' boolean, so entering search terms in more than one box would enforce all of them in the final result set.</p>

<p>Be aware that many station names are abbreviated throughout the database.  In addition, if you attempt to return a large number of station results using this product (for instance, all stations in New York), the web server will likely time out and you will receive a blank result page.  If this happens to you, please make your query more specific and try again.  If you have a specific need for a mass download of all partial duration series, please contact us.</p>
