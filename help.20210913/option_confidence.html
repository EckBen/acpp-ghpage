<h1>Confidence Limits</h1>

<p>This option will display the lower and upper confidence limit bounds on the product output.  The confidence limits calculated here are 90% intervals, and the lower and upper bounds represent the 5th and 95th percentile respectively.  These bounds were calculated via a Monte Carlo approach with 1,000 trials, then the intervals were gridded and smoothed across the entire region.</p>
