<h1>Search by State</h1>

<p>Option box appears only on PDS by Station product.</p>

<p>This search box will allow users to limit their partial duration series search to a specific state.  It is highly recommended use of this search box be combined with either the "Search by Name" or "Search by Station ID" products.  If there are too many results, the server will likely time out and show a blank response.  If this happens, please limit your search query (by making it more specific) and try again.</p>
